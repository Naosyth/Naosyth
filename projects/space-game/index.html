<h2 id="about-this-project">About This Project</h2>

<p>This is my final project for CS 381 (Game Engine Development). It is a three dimensional game set in space, where the player must protect a cargo ship that is under attack, as it flies towards a jump game. The gameplay is not very imaginative, as the main goal of this project was to implement the control math for character / camera movement and rotation. This was my first time working in depth with quaternions, which can seem intimidating at first, but are actually pretty nice to work with.</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>This game was built using <a href="http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Python-Ogre">Python-Ogre</a>, which handeled the rendering pipeline. Everything else was built from scratch using Python. The models were exported from the Tribes 2 Construction Mod using a script I wrote several years before this project, which converted structures built in-game to <code>.obj</code> files. These were then cleaned up and given very basic textures with <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>.</p>
